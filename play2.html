                                                                                And bare skin makes on you a big impression.
                                                                                I truly don't know why you feel such passion;
                                                                                I myself think lust is out of fashion,
                                                                                For I could see you nude from top to toe
                                                                                Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.</p>
                <h4 class="name" >TARTUFFE.</h4><p class="speech TARTUFFE" >Put a little modesty in your discourse
                                                                                   Or I must leave you instantly perforce.</p>
                <h4 class="name" >DORINE.</h4><p class="speech DORINE" >No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,
                                                                               And I will just say this before I cease:
                                                                               Madam is coming down to visit you
                                                                               And demands the favor of a rendezvous.</p>
