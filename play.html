        Tartuffe,Damis,Dorine<br>
    </h5>
    <p><h6>Tartuffe</h6>[observing Dorine].<p>Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                                           And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                                           If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                                           To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.<br></p>
        <h6>Dorine</h6> [aside].<p>Such affectation and boastful behavior!<br></p>
        <h6>Tartuffe</h6>.<p>What do you wish?<br></p>
        <h6>Dorine</h6>.<p>To say . . .<br></p>
        <h6>Tartuffe</h6> [taking a handkerchief from his pocket].<p>Wait!  By our Savior,
                                                                     Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.<br></p>
        <h6>Dorine</h6>.<p>Why?<br></p>
        <h6>Tartuffe</h6>.<p>Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                            Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                            And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.<br></p></p>
