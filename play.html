    <h5>ACT III<br>

        Tartuffe,Damis,Dorine<br>
    </h5>
    <p>Tartuffe [observing Dorine].  Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                                     And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                                     If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                                     To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.<br>
        Dorine [aside].  Such affectation and boastful behavior!<br>
        Tartuffe.  What do you wish?<br>
        Dorine.  To say . . .<br>
        Tartuffe [taking a handkerchief from his pocket].  Wait!  By our Savior,
                                                           Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.<br>
        Dorine.  Why?<br>
        Tartuffe.  Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                   Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                   And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.<br></p>
