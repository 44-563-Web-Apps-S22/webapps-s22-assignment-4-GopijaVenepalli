    <h1>ACT III

        Tartuffe,Damis,Dorine
    </h1>
    <p>Tartuffe [observing Dorine].  Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                                     And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                                     If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                                     To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.
        Dorine [aside].  Such affectation and boastful behavior!
        Tartuffe.  What do you wish?
        Dorine.  To say . . .
        Tartuffe [taking a handkerchief from his pocket].  Wait!  By our Savior,
                                                           Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.
        Dorine.  Why?
        Tartuffe.  Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                   Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                   And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.</p>
