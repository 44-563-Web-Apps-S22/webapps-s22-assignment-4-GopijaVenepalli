    <h3>ACT III Tartuffe,Damis,Dorine</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Tartuffe.</h4><p>[observing Dorine]</p><p>Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
                                           And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                                           If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                                           To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.
        <h4>Dorine.</h4><p>[aside]</p><p>Such affectation and boastful behavior!</p>
        <h4>Tartuffe.</h4><p>What do you wish?</p>
        <h4>Dorine.</h4><p>To say . . .</p>
        <h4>Tartuffe.</h4><p>[taking a handkerchief from his pocket]</p><p>Wait!  By our Savior,
                                                                    Please!  Before you speak take this handkerchief.</p>
        <h4>Dorine.</h4><p>Why?</p>
        <h4>Tartuffe.</h4><p>Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                            Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                            And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.</p>
